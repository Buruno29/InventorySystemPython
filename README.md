Meant to be an old school Python Project.
No Graphic Interface no nothing, just an easy and adaptable system made using only Python File Handling.

A good Start for those who may be in need of learning about it.

The Programs are on Snippets, I have realized there is an issue with addresses that I will take a look into later on, for the time being, if you want to download and use, put it on C dir and rename the main folder to be "InventorySystemPython".

The 0password file is just a small password system to compare a string to a file, yes, not safe, but I am not applying it in all files, its just a ready snippet in case you want to use it at the beginning.

Let me know if I forgot anything else, this project is kind of a rewrite of what I had already made, so I need to collect the found issues, needed adaptations and change it once I can.

I am aware that making a hub file would be the best and instead i kept the funcionalities separated by program, it was because of the intended context of usage.
To adapt to older Python versions, say Python 3.7
You will have to change match value into if-else.
