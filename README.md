Meant to be an old school Python Project.
No Graphic Interface no nothing, just an easy and adaptable system made using only Python File Handling.
A good Start for those who may be in need of such.
The 0password file is just a small password system to compare a string to a file, yes, not safe, but I am not applying it in all files, its just a ready snippet in case you want to use it at the beginning.
I am aware that making a hub file would be the best and instead i kept the funcionalities separated by program, it was because of the intended context of usage.
To adapt to older Python versions, say Python 3.7
You will have to change my switch into ifelse.
